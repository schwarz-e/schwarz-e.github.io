## Teaching Philosophy  

Teaching excellence is a critical part of the academic research environment. By connecting theory to practical problem solving, we can empower students to address pressing challenges across research and industry. I also believe that fostering an equitable and inclusive research environment strengthens the scientific community by allowing diverse perspectives to drive innovation and discovery.  

As an assistant professor at UC Berkeley, I will use this philosophy to teach fundamental mechanical engineering courses and expand the mechanical engineering curriculum to more deeply encompass the intersection between mechanical engineering and biological sciences.

## Teaching Experience  

I have greatly valued my opportunities to teach and have found them to be an extremely meaningful part of my research career.  

As a graduate student at Stanford, I served as a teaching assistant for *Bioengineering Senior Capstone Design*. In this course, I conducted lectures on project design, provided feedback on project documents, and offered technical assistance in constructing, testing, and validating mechanical prototypes. Under my guidance, these design teams were competitive for awards from national engineering challenges and translational research grants.  

I have additionally led technical courses. I served as the teaching assistant for *Computational Modeling in the Cardiovascular System*, a graduate-level course that covered analytical and computational methods for simulating cardiovascular fluid dynamics. My responsibilities included leading discussion sections where I prepared miniature lectures and application-based examples to supplement the main course. I built an inclusive learning environment by encouraging students to ask questions and taking the time to discuss any knowledge gaps both as a group and individually.  

I received exceptionally positive feedback on my teaching. Quotes from students’ anonymous feedback included:  
> “I really couldn't have asked for a better TA. Erica was phenomenal.”

> “Erica is one of the best TAs I have had at Stanford.”  

> “She was extremely patient when teaching [...] very good at explaining difficult concepts, especially in terms of drawing things and explaining ideas visually.”  

> “Erica was clearly very knowledgeable, and I always felt like she was really prepared for office hours and lectures.”  

Since becoming a postdoctoral researcher, I have continued to strive for teaching excellence. I have been a guest lecturer at multiple institutions in both the Mechanical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering Departments.  
- **UCSD:** Graduate-level lecture on soft-tissue growth and remodeling for *Cardiovascular Fluid Mechanics*, including flow-mediated mechanotransduction modeling techniques.  
- **Yale University:** Guest lectures in *Discover and Design in Biomedical Research*, outlining the process of completing a biomedical research project from conception to execution.  
- **Yale University:** Two-part lecture series on vector calculus in *Mathematical Methods I*.  

Through these teaching opportunities, I have continued to hone and improve my teaching skills. This included pursuing the **Certificate of College Teaching Preparation** offered by the Yale Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning, which provides resources for creating inclusive classroom climates and building awareness of implicit biases in education.  

As part of this process, I received formal observation and feedback from the Poorvu Center for Teaching and Learning on my *Mathematical Methods I* lectures. Their trained observer highlighted my ability to create a safe and welcoming learning environment and to modify my teaching approach in real-time to meet the needs of students. Their feedback stated:  
> “Erica gave students positive feedback when they asked questions, which created a comfortable environment. It was also clear that Erica used student questions as a kind of informal feedback for her own teaching.”

## Mentoring Experience  

Mentorship is a critically important part of research. Throughout my time as a graduate student and post-doctoral researcher, I have been the primary mentor for four undergraduates and two graduate students. For each of these mentees, I synthesized their unique backgrounds, skills, and future goals to inform my approach to mentorship.  

To support this, I organized and led supplemental technical workshops on coding, mathematical modeling, and academic writing to ensure each mentee started their research experience with strong foundational skills. This allowed all mentees to excel regardless of their starting skill level.  

My ability to provide mentorship to diverse mentees is illustrated by my work with two undergraduate students. These undergraduates began working with me through individual summer programs, one of which focused on serving underrepresented minorities in STEM. After their initial summer projects, I continued to mentor them for three years on an independent research project, which they published in a peer-reviewed journal as first and second authors respectively.  

One of these students, a first-generation college student, sought to attend medical school after his undergraduate education. To aid him in this goal, I provided mentorship on scholarship resources, aided in the preparation of application materials, and wrote letters of recommendation that spoke to his skills and persistence as a biomedical researcher. He was accepted to several medical schools and matriculated this fall.  

At UC Berkeley, I will continue to provide strong mentorship both within my research group and in the wider university environment. This will include serving as a faculty mentor for organizations such as the **Society of Women Engineers** and conducting outreach to prospective students through summer programs and recruitment events.

## Teaching Plans  

I have a rigorous interdisciplinary background in mechanical engineering, computer science, and biomedical engineering. As such, I am uniquely positioned to teach classes at the intersection of mechanical engineering and biological sciences.  

At UC Berkeley, this would include core classes in the Mechanical Engineering Department, such as:  
- **ME 260:** Advanced Fluid Mechanics  
- **ME 280A:** Introduction to the Finite Element Method  
- **ME C213:** Fluid Mechanics of Biological Systems  

I would also be enthusiastic to develop new courses that strengthen the mechanobiology instruction at UC Berkeley, focusing on how fluid dynamics and mechanotransduction influence health and disease:  

1. **Cardiovascular Fluid Dynamics**  
   Graduate-level course on modeling blood flow in deformable vessels. Covers 3D flow equations, lumped parameter models, and biomechanics of the circulatory system. Integrates application-based lectures providing overviews of cardiovascular diseases.  

2. **Mechanics of Growth and Remodeling**  
   Graduate-level course examining how mechanical forces influence the development of living systems, including bone, blood vessels, and skin. Covers kinematic growth theory, constrained mixture theory, and cell-signaling models.  

3. **Computational Modeling of Tissue Engineering**  
   Graduate-level course focused on modeling and optimizing key stages of the tissue engineering process, including bioreactor flow, dynamic tissue conditioning, and in vivo development modeling.  

These classes sit at the intersection of mechanical engineering and bioengineering while imparting robust technical and research skills that benefit students across both disciplines.

## Summary  

Feedback from both students and professional teaching staff demonstrates that I am able to create a safe, inclusive learning environment that supports both technical mastery and project-based excellence. My record of mentorship—evidenced by mentees’ peer-reviewed publications and acceptance into top-level graduate and professional programs—demonstrates my ability to serve as a faculty-level research mentor and instructor.
