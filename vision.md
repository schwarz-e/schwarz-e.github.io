# Research Vision  
**Erica L. Schwarz, Ph.D.**

## Vision
Computational modeling has the potential to revolutionize cardiovascular healthcare.  
However, current methods are limited in predicting long-term, patient-specific outcomes.  
My research vision is to develop the next generation of **multiscale computational models** by integrating **mechanistic growth and remodeling (G&R)** into **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** simulations of complex cardiovascular geometries.  

My background in mechanical engineering, bioengineering, and computer science uniquely positions me to address these challenges, as demonstrated by my leadership in multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional collaborations.

---

## Significance
The **FDA** and other leading medical organizations have recognized computational modeling as key to accelerating medical innovation.  
Physics-based simulations of cardiovascular systems are now routinely used to model **hemodynamics, tissue mechanics, and physiology**, but multiscale models are needed to predict **long-term, clinically relevant outcomes** across complex disease states.

---

## Approach
I couple **finite-element simulations** of cardiovascular structures with **reduced-order circulation models** to form a multiscale description of cardiovascular flow.  
These models quantify both local and organ-level hemodynamics and integrate **mechanobiologically-driven G&R** to predict **long-term outcomes** of disease and intervention.

## Doctoral Research
During my Ph.D. at **Stanford University** with Dr. Alison Marsden, I led a detailed analysis of the first U.S. **clinical trial of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs)** for congenital heart defects.  
I coupled **patient-specific CFD** with **lumped parameter networks (LPNs)** to identify geometric thresholds for symptomatic behavior — insights that informed clinical trial renewal.

I later developed a **3D fluid–solid–growth (FSG)** framework capable of simulating mechanobiologically-driven G&R within a **finite element FSI solver**, enabling prediction of changing hemodynamics, wall morphology, and material properties.  
This work increased the clinical relevance of CFD and earned recognition as a **Melosh Medal finalist** for outstanding research in computational mechanics.

## Postdoctoral Research
At **Yale University** with Dr. Jay Humphrey, I extended G&R frameworks by integrating **time-resolved gene expression** data from RNA sequencing into a **constrained mixture model** of pulmonary artery development.  
This work will be applied to study how **hypoxia** alters pulmonary vascular development in congenital heart defects.

I also applied **machine learning** to improve predictive modeling of aneurysm progression.  
Using the FSG framework, I generated **synthetic cohorts of aneurysm models** and worked with ML experts to identify **neural operators** capable of forecasting aneurysm growth, establishing a foundation for **transfer learning** from simulated to clinical datasets.

## Future Research Directions

### 1. Multiscale, Multi-Organ Growth and Remodeling for Congenital Heart Defects
- **Goal:** Couple 3D cardiovascular models to low-dimensional LPNs where both evolve under mechanobiological G&R laws.  
- **Approach:** Retrospective analysis of clinical pressure, flow, and oxygenation data (via UCSF collaborators) will identify governing G&R parameters in circulation.  
- **Outcome:** Enable **personalized CHD treatment** by predicting long-term outcomes and organ-level adaptations.

### 2. Multiscale, Multi-Cell Growth and Remodeling for Vascular Grafts
- **Goal:** Integrate **cell-signaling networks** into FSG models to link drug interventions and tissue remodeling.  
- **Approach:** Study **macrophage-mediated inflammation** and **smooth muscle remodeling** under various pharmacological treatments (e.g., mTOR inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists).  
- **Outcome:** Identify **optimal therapeutic pathways** and delivery schedules to maintain graft patency.

---

### 3. Next-Generation Intracranial Aneurysm Prediction
- **Goal:** Simulate aneurysm evolution by linking oscillatory shear stress to mechanobiological G&R.  
- **Approach:** Use **FSG simulations** to generate data for **neural operator training**, improving clinical forecasting of aneurysm rupture.  
- **Outcome:** Provide **predictive, mechanistic tools** to reduce aneurysm-related morbidity and mortality.

## Funding
- **NSF Graduate Research Fellowship** (Ph.D.)  
- **AHA Predoctoral Fellowship** (Ph.D.)  
- **NSF ACCESS Resource Award (PI)** (Postdoc)

As an assistant professor, I will pursue **NIH R21 and R01 grants** (NHLBI, NIBIB), and targeted funding from **AHA**, **Children’s Heart Foundation**, and **Marfan Foundation**.  
I will also mentor students to pursue **NSF, AHA, HHMI, and NIH fellowships**.

## Collaborations
At **UC Berkeley**, I will:
- Collaborate with the **Berkeley Biomechanics Laboratory** (Dr. Shawn Shadden) on cardiovascular fluid dynamics and open-source modeling (SimVascular).  
- Partner with clinicians at **UCSF’s Cardiovascular Research Institute** to validate computational predictions and enhance clinical translation.
