## Vision

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. Many biomedical advancements have deepened our understanding of vascular biology, including the use of **RNA-sequencing** to identify changes in gene expression that both cause and are caused by disease. Despite this, translating these findings into clinically actionable models that can guide patient-specific treatment plans has yet to be accomplished. This gap exists because it remains difficult to bridge how cellular-level behavior translates to alteres tissue-level mechanics and affects whole-body cardiovascular performance. I will lead research that integrates multiscale data-- from molecular and cellular measurements to organ-scale mechanics-- into cardiovascular models that will generate **actionable predictions** of human-scale cardiovascular outcomes and provide new insights into the biomechanical drivers of disease.

My research vision is to integrate nascent technologies, including **RNA-sequencing informed cell-signalling networks**, into physics-based simulations of **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** and **growth and remodeling (G&R) frameworks** to capture both biochemical and hemodynamic drivers of vascular function. This will create predictive tools that clinicians can use **safely and reliably** in cardiovascular care. Such models will also provide **robust and interpretable** in silico datasets that can be used to train **artificial intelligence** frameworks, accelerating their validation and translation into the clinical setting.

My background in mechanical engineering, bioengineering, and computer science strongly equips me to address these challenges, as demonstrated by my previous success in leading multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional projects.

## Significance
The **FDA** and other leading medical organizations have recognized computational modeling as key to accelerating medical innovation.  
Physics-based simulations of cardiovascular systems are now routinely used to model **hemodynamics, tissue mechanics, and physiology**, but multiscale models are needed to predict **long-term, clinically relevant outcomes** across complex disease states.

## Approach
I couple **finite-element simulations** of cardiovascular structures with **reduced-order circulation models** to form a multiscale description of cardiovascular flow.  
These models quantify both local and organ-level hemodynamics and integrate **mechanobiologically-driven G&R** to predict **long-term outcomes** of disease and intervention.

## Doctoral Research
During my Ph.D. at **Stanford University** with Dr. Alison Marsden, I led a detailed analysis of the first U.S. **clinical trial of tissue-engineered vascular grafts (TEVGs)** for congenital heart defects.  
I coupled **patient-specific CFD** with **lumped parameter networks (LPNs)** to identify geometric thresholds for symptomatic behavior — insights that informed clinical trial renewal.

I later developed a **3D fluid–solid–growth (FSG)** framework capable of simulating mechanobiologically-driven G&R within a **finite element FSI solver**, enabling prediction of changing hemodynamics, wall morphology, and material properties.  
This work increased the clinical relevance of CFD and earned recognition as a **Melosh Medal finalist** for outstanding research in computational mechanics.

## Postdoctoral Research
At **Yale University** with Dr. Jay Humphrey, I extended G&R frameworks by integrating **time-resolved gene expression** data from RNA sequencing into a **constrained mixture model** of pulmonary artery development.  
This work will be applied to study how **hypoxia** alters pulmonary vascular development in congenital heart defects.

I also applied **machine learning** to improve predictive modeling of aneurysm progression.  
Using the FSG framework, I generated **synthetic cohorts of aneurysm models** and worked with ML experts to identify **neural operators** capable of forecasting aneurysm growth, establishing a foundation for **transfer learning** from simulated to clinical datasets.
