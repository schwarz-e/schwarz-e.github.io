_Computational Mechanobiology â€¢ Vascular Growth & Remodeling â€¢ Neural Operators_

Welcome! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University studying **vascular biomechanics and growth and remodeling (G&R)** through **computational and data-driven models**.  

My work bridges **mechanical engineering, biology, and applied mathematics** to understand and predict how vessels evolve over time in order to aid clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.

I am currently focused on integrating **neural operator frameworks** with **constrained mixture theory** to forecast aneurysm progression and identify biomechanical predictors of rupture risk.

## Research Vision
Computational modeling is transforming cardiovascular healthcare, yet current models fall short in predicting **long-term, patient-specific outcomes**.  

My vision is to develop **next-generation multiscale models** that integrate **mechanistic growth and remodeling (G&R)** into **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** simulations of complex cardiovascular geometries.  

This approach couples **organ-scale hemodynamics** with **cell- and tissue-level remodeling**, bridging physics-based simulation and machine learning to enable clinically actionable predictions.
