_Computational Mechanobiology â€¢ Vascular Growth & Remodeling â€¢ Neural Operators_

Welcome! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University studying **vascular biomechanics and growth and remodeling (G&R)** through **computational and data-driven models**.  

My work bridges **mechanical engineering, biology, and applied mathematics** to understand and predict how vessels evolve over time in order to aid clinical diagnosis and treatment planning.

I am currently focused on integrating **neural operator frameworks** with **constrained mixture theory** to forecast aneurysm progression and identify biomechanical predictors of rupture risk.
