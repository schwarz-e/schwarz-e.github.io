Welcome! Iâ€™m a postdoctoral researcher at Yale University studying **vascular biomechanics** through **computational and data-driven models**.

My work bridges **mechanical engineering, biology, and applied mathematics** to understand and predict how vessels evolve over time.

I am currently working on integrating **constrained mixture theory** of vascular growth and remodeling with **neural operator frameworks** to forecast aneurysm progression and identify biomechanical predictors of rupture risk.

## Research Vision
Computational modeling is transforming cardiovascular healthcare, yet current models fall short in predicting **long-term, patient-specific outcomes**.  

My vision is to develop **next-generation multiscale models** that integrate **mechanistic growth and remodeling (G&R)** into **computational fluid dynamics (CFD)** simulations of complex cardiovascular geometries.  

This approach couples **organ-scale hemodynamics** with **cell- and tissue-level remodeling** to: 

- identify biomechanical causes of disease initiation and progression
- enable precision treatment planning that reduces morbidity and mortality due to cardiovascular disease
- and leverage physics-based simulations with nascent machine learning techniques to enable clinically actionable predictions.
