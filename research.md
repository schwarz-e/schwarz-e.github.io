## Multiphysics Modeling and Solver Development
Studies focused on developing multiphysics solvers capable of simulating complex cardiovascular behavior. This includes integrating mathematical models of fluid dynamics, vascular morphology, tissue composition, and material properties into **finite-element** frameworks and designing novel **numerical methods** to improve accuracy and computational efficiency. The resulting solvers have been used for [translational research](/research/translation) and are available as open-source tools for the scientific community.
