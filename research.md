## Multiphysics Modeling and Solver Development
I have developed multiphysics solvers capable of simulating complex cardiovascular behavior. This includes integrating mathematical models of fluid dynamics and vascular solid mechanics into **finite-element** frameworks and designing novel **numerical methods** to improve accuracy and computational efficiency. The resulting solvers have been used for [translational research](/research/translation) and are available as open-source tools for the scientific community.

## Predictive Modeling and Clinical Translation
I collaborate extensively with **multi-institutional teams** of clinicians and researchers to advance the development of **tissue-engineered vascular grafts**, using computational models of vascular behavior to predict surgical outcomes and define safety limits for cardiovascular function. These computational tools can directly accelerate the clinical translation of new medical technologies.

## Multiscale Modeling and Machine Learning Integration
Artificial intelligence is increasingly ubiquitous in research and medicine. However, proper training and validation of these large-data models are critical for safe adoption in the clinical setting.  

I have used **multiscale physics-based simulations** based on interpretable biological and clinical findings to create high-fidelity data **for training neural operators**. Such simulations can be varied based on population distributions of vascular geometries, material properties, and hemodynamics to create a rich, clinically-relevant datasets at a volume that would be impossible to generate *in-vivo*. By bridging these biomechanical models with machine learning tools, we can greatly accelerate adoption of artificial intelligence for clinical prediction while maintaining robust standards of **data transparency and quality**.
