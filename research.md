Other themes in my research include:

## [Neural Operator Forecasting of Aortic Aneurysm Growth](/research/pulmonary)
Developed a **neural operator-based framework** to predict time evolution of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) using both clinical imaging data and simulation-informed biomechanical parameters.

## [Constrained Mixture Theory of Growth and Remodeling](/research/aorta)
Built and simulated **3D models of arterial G&R** capturing stable dilation, aneurysm growth, and rupture.  
Incorporated **rate-based elastin production and degradation dynamics**, enabling mechanistic insights into tissue remodeling.

## [Vessel Mechanics and Biaxial Testing](/research/aorta)
Analyzed **biaxial mechanical data** to quantify stress invariants and collagen fiber recruitment.  
Generated **pressure–diameter** and **force–length** relationships to calibrate material parameters.

## [Computational Methods](/research/large-data)
Implemented **Brent root-finding** and **finite element–based solvers** for vessel equilibrium states.  
Developed MATLAB and Python pipelines for large-scale parameter sweeps and classification heatmaps.
