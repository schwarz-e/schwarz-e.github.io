## Multiphysics Modeling and Solver Development
I have developed multiphysics solvers capable of simulating complex cardiovascular behavior. This includes integrating mathematical models of fluid dynamics and vascular solid mechanics into **finite-element** frameworks and designing novel **numerical methods** to improve accuracy and computational efficiency. The resulting solvers have been used for [translational research](/research/translation) and are available as open-source tools for the scientific community.

## Predictive Modeling of Vascular Grafts and Clinical Translation
I collaborate extensively with **multi-institutional teams** of clinicians and researchers to advance the development of **tissue-engineered vascular grafts**, using computational models of vascular behavior to predict surgical outcomes and define safety limits for cardiovascular function. These computational tools can directly accelerate the clinical translation of new medical technologies.

## Multiscale Modeling and Machine Learning Integration
No one can escape the mesmerizing pull of artificial intelligence. However, knowing how to use it makes all the difference between a navel-gazing calculator and a powerful tool that can greatly improve quality of life. I have .

Physics-based simulations provide high-fidelity data based on interpretable biological and clinical findings. Such simulations can be varied based on population distributions of vascular geometries, material properties, and hemodynamics to create a rich data-set that would be impossible to generate *in-vivo*. By coupling these models to neural operators, 

My philosophy is that by bridging these biomechanical models with machine learning tools, we can greatly accelerate adoption of artificial intelligence for clinical prediction while maintaining robust standards of data transparency and quality.

Development of **computational, machine learning, and multiscale modeling tools** to predict cardiovascular outcomes.
