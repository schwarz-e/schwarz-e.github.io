# Pulmonary Research

Mechanistic studies of **pulmonary artery development** and tissue engineering strategies, combining transcriptomic, histological, and biophysical analyses to understand postnatal pulmonary growth and graft integration.

### Research Development
Research progressed from early **Fontan conduit design simulations** (2022â€“2025) to **integrated pulmonary artery development mapping** (2025), combining computational modeling and experimental validation for translational impact.

### Selected Publications

- **Postnatal Pulmonary Artery Development From Transcript to Tissue** (2025)
