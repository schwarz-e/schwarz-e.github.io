# Large Data & Computational Methods

### Theme
Development of **computational, machine learning, and multiscale modeling tools** to study cardiovascular growth, remodeling, and prediction of disease progression.

### Temporal Workflow
Research began with **robust FSG solvers and predictive frameworks** (2023–2024), then progressed to **machine learning-driven identification of cellular and biomechanical drivers** (2024–2025), enabling cross-scale prediction of cardiovascular outcomes.
