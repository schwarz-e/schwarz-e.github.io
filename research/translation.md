# Aortic Research

### Theme
Studies of **thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms**, growth, remodeling, and patient-specific hemodynamics using computational frameworks and tissue-level models.

### Temporal Workflow
Research progressed from **patient-specific CFD of aneurysms** (2022–2023) to **integrated vascular graft modeling** (2022–2025), highlighting translation from computational predictions to engineered tissue outcomes.

### Selected Publications

- **A Matched-pair Case Control Study Identifying Hemodynamic Predictors of Cerebral Aneurysm Growth Using Computational Fluid Dynamics** (2023)
