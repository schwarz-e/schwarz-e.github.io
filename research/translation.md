# Predictive Modeling and Clinical Translation

I collaborate extensively with **multi-institutional teams** of clinicians and researchers to advance the development of **tissue-engineered vascular grafts**, using computational models of vascular behavior to predict surgical outcomes and define safety limits for cardiovascular function. These computational tools directly accelerate the clinical translation of new medical technologies. 

### Research Pathway
In 20XX the first U.S. clinical trial of tissue-engineered vascular grafts began at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Previous studies in Japan had shown the efficacy of tissue-engineered vascular grafts to replace the synthetic grafts traditional used in patients undergoing the Fontan procedure. However, upon imaging the first four patients in the U.S. trial 6 months post-operation, clinicians observed that the grafts had undergone significant stenosis (narrowing). While generally asymptomatic, this stenosis concerned clinicians and the clinical trial was paused to answer the question **"Does the stenosis of TEVGs be harmful to patients?"**. I began work modeling the cardiovascular system of post-operational Fontan patients. I defined new models for **aid FDA approval**
 
My work in clinically translating computational models has since continued and expanded to include investigations of outcomes in aortic aneurysm, cerebral aneurysms, etc etc.


As a graduate student at *Stanford University* I began work on modeling the effects **tissue-engineered vascular grafts** had.  Research progressed from **patient-specific CFD of aneurysms** (2022–2023) to **integrated vascular graft modeling** (2022–2025), highlighting translation from computational predictions to engineered tissue outcomes.
